# The logical running path #

The logical running path is created according to the [LRPE](LRPE.md) (logical running path evaluation) process.

The logical running path is a sequence of logical control points (see [RunModel](RunModel.md)) equipped with the arrival and leave time (the arrival and leave time may differ if two or more people form a team).
