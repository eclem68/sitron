Welcome to the sitron project.

The goal of this project is to create an open-source orienteering organizer (see [ProjectGoals](ProjectGoals.md))

The real programming job has not yet started. We want to make a precise analysis first. The bad news is that if you need now an orienteering organizer, we do not have it. But if you are a developer, you can help us with the development.

The main parts we want to create are described in [MainComponents](MainComponents.md). For more information look at our [wiki](http://code.google.com/p/sitron/w/list).

We also have a mailing list sitron-project@googlegroups.com.
